# Insert Mode Tricks

- `<i>`: insert - puts you at the front of the cursor
- `<I>`: Insert at the beginning of the line - puts you at the front of the line
- `<a>`: append - puts you at the back of the cursor
- `<A>`: Append at the end of the line - puts you at the end of the line
- `<o>`: Open a new line below - inserts a new line below the cursor
- `<O>`: Open a new line above - inserts a new line above the cursor
- `<gi>`: go to last insert mode - takes you to the last place you were in "insert" mode
